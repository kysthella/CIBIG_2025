# 1. Definition


According to the WHO, a resistant strain is a strain that can withstand a higher concentration of antibiotics \
than that which inhibits the development of the majority of strains of the same species.

# 2. Types

## Natural or intrinsic resistance
This refers to the ability of all strains of a bacterial species or genus to resist the presence of an antibiotic. \
It is stable, transmitted to offspring (its genetic basis is the bacterial chromosome), but it is not, or only minimally,\
transmissible horizontally (from one bacterium to another within the same species or between different species).

## Acquired resistance
This is a characteristic that affects only a few strains of a given species.Acquired resistance is less stable, \
but it often spreads widely throughout the bacterial world. It results from a modification of the bacterium's genetic makeup, \
allowing it to tolerate a higher concentration of antibiotic than that which inhibits susceptible strains of the same species.

### Mode of acquisition of antibiotic resistance
. Resistance through chromosomal mutation:\
It is a random phenomenon and It is not caused by the presence of the antibiotic. However, the antibiotic reveals the resistance mutation\
by selecting for resistant mutant bacteria. This is an independent phenomenon, the appearance of one mutation does not promote the appearance of\
other resistance mutations to other antibiotics. It is transmissible; it is permanent and therefore has a hereditary character \
(transmission in a vertical manner from mother bacteria to daughter bacteria). All mutations result in the loss or modification of a structural or enzymatic protein.\

. Resistance by acquisition of exogenous genetic material:\
This type of resistance results from the acquisition of resistance genes via a plasmid or transposons through 3 possible exchange mechanisms:\
             conjugation (This is a DNA exchange mechanism occurring between a donor cell and a recipient cell byconjugation pilus, which then makes contact with the recipient cell.\
                         Once contact is established, a plasmid or a portion of a chromosome carrying the origin of transfer (oriT) can be transmitted.)\
             transformation (It occurs when foreign DNA present in the extracellular environment is taken up into a so-called "competent" cell. The maintenance of this DNA is limited by\
                            its ability to self-replicate, integrate into the chromosome, or be translated)
             transposition (It occurs during the erroneous encapsidation of bacterial genomic DNA during the replication cycle of a bacteriophage, followed by the subsequent infection of another bacterium\
                           by this defective phage.)


MDR was defined as acquired non-susceptibility to at least one agent in  three or more antimicrobial categories, \
XDR was defined as non-susceptibility to at least one agent in all but two or fewer antimicrobial categories \
PDR was defined as non-susceptibility  to all agents in all antimicrobial categories. (Magiorakos et al.)
